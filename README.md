# Miniex4
This weeks miniex is about datacapture. So I've tried making something that responds to the theme. My program is based on multiple choice. On the front page there are two tv-shows which you can choose from. Depending on what you choose, a suggestion (judgement) specific to your choice appears.

To make this program I've used conditional statements, the mousepressed function, buttons, and self made functions specific to the buttons. In order to make my program I had to make different conditional statements. At first I thought that it would be rather simple. But the problem was that I needed a result for each button. To do that, I had to use the if and else functions. Technically I didn't really succeed. If I pressed the second button the result of the first button would still appear... I fixed my program by manipulating the size of the text (so that it covered the result of the first button. It's not perfect but it works (fake it till you make it). 

My program captures where you click (your preference) and provides you with new information/results based on your click. So basically it is built the same way as any other data capturing software. My program is inspired by the analytic softwares described as cookies. I bet you're familiar with this; "based on your previous purchase we think you might like this". In order to make this judgement the software analyzes every users actions online (purchases, views, clicks etc.) and compares them with other users. This type of software analyzes you from a solely objective point of view. All it does is try to guess you preferences based on your own actions or those of others. But it can never judge your actual character og personality. Only humans are capable of doing this. This is why I have a little twist in my program. My program actually passes judgment on you based on your preference. What if computers did this? Would we trust them so blindly as we do now? I don't think so. The reason we're willing to provide a computer with so much information about is that it's just a computer. We know that a computer is not capable of judging us, so what we do online is like our own little secret. 

Data capturing has become almost anonomous, and if not that then faceless. Companies can gain so much information from us, at a capacity they would never be able to reach without the computer. If an actual person ha to capture all that data, it just wouldn't be possible. No one would let a stranger watch their every move during the day (not for free anyway). That is why datacapturing is such a genius invention.
